## Application Overview
I have been developing a music streaming application similar to the global Spotify platform as a training project. This application allows users to play songs and enjoy a seamless music experience. All songs have been uploaded to Firebase, leveraging its robust and scalable infrastructure to handle media storage and streaming.
